README
==============================================

This is a password generator and manager
made as a final project for my Python class.
It is really my first Python project that I
coded on my own. It is simple, but I learned 
a lot along the way. Perhaps I will revisit this
when I learn more about encryption.

Based on user input, you can generate a random
password using upper and lower case letters,
numbers, and special characters. While it is
designed to meet the password reqirements 
of most websites, I included an ASCII cheat
sheet should you want to change it up even more.

Data is stored in info.txt, which is generated
for you the first time you run the code. Although
your account info is viewable within the Python
console as well.

Thanks for checking out my password generator
and manager! :)
